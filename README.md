# Beijing Hotel Classic Cookbook (Âåó‰∫¨È•≠Â∫óÂêçËèúË∞±) Digital Remake

## Overview

This project is a digital remake of the **1958 edition of Âåó‰∫¨È•≠Â∫óÂêçËèúË∞±
(Beijing Hotel Classic Cookbook)**, originally published by the Beijing Hotel
Editorial Team (Âåó‰∫¨È•≠Â∫óÁºñÂÜôÁªÑ). The cookbook contains a collection of classic
Chinese recipes from the renowned Beijing Hotel, which has long been regarded
as a symbol of Beijing's culinary excellence.

Due to the original book's use of **acidic paper** and poor binding quality,
it has deteriorated significantly over time. This project aims to **digitally
restore, proofread, and reformat** the cookbook while preserving its
**authenticity and historical value**.

## Project Goals

- **Digitally preserve** the original cookbook by providing high-quality
  scans, image processing, and releasing it in open formats.
- **Modernize the text** while maintaining the original culinary authenticity.
- **Standardize formatting** using **LaTeX** to ensure a polished,
  professional final version.
- **Promote open-source collaboration** by inviting community contributions to
  **proofread, edit, and improve** the content.

## Release Versions

| Version  | Status  | Description |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **0.0.1 pre-Alpha** | ‚úÖ Released | "Poor Man's Photocopy Edition" ‚Äì Raw scanned pages, processed for readability. |
| **Upcoming Versions** | üöß In Progress | Proofread text, OCR refinement, LaTeX formatting, and structured editing. |

You can download the latest release from the
**[Releases](https://github.com/neo954/beijing-hotel-classic-cookbook/releases)**
page.

## How to Contribute

We welcome **proofreaders, editors, and LaTeX contributors**! If you would
like to help, follow these steps:

1. **Check Open Issues** ‚Äì Find a recipe that needs proofreading by visiting
the [Issues](https://github.com/neo954/beijing-hotel-classic-cookbook/issues)
tab.
2. **Assign Yourself an Issue** ‚Äì Select a recipe and mark it as **"In
Progress"**.
3. **Download the Text File** ‚Äì Each recipe is available in a separate file.
4. **Proofread & Edit** ‚Äì Correct **OCR mistakes, standardize characters, and
ensure proper formatting**.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** ‚Äì After completing your edits, submit a **PR**
referencing the specific issue.

### Proofreading Guidelines
- Standardize characters to **modern Simplified Chinese** (e.g., `ËïÉËåÑ ‚ûù
  Áï™ËåÑ`).
- Retain ingredient names historically accurate while ensuring no alterations
  to the original content.

## Project Scope

- **Textual Modernization:** The original text will be proofread and updated
  with modern Chinese characters, simplified where applicable, while
maintaining the integrity and historical value of the recipes.
- **High-Quality Scans:** The physical book will be scanned at resolutions of
  **400dpi or higher**, with image processing to ensure clarity and
readability.
- **Versioning and Workflow:** The project will follow an agile development
  model, with sprints and incremental releases. Each completed recipe will be
available as a separate file. Contributions, including proofreading and recipe
validation, will be open to the community.

## Goals

- **Preserve Beijing Hotel's Culinary Heritage:** Safeguard and protect the
  historical dishes of the Beijing Hotel.
- **Share Traditional Recipes with Modern Audiences:** Make these time-honored
  recipes accessible to contemporary chefs and home cooks.
- **Encourage Community Collaboration:** Foster community-driven proofreading
  and testing to improve the quality of the project.

## Features

- **Digital Remake:** The original recipes will be digitized and preserved in
  high-quality formats for broader accessibility.
- **Collaboration-Friendly:** This project is open-source on GitHub, allowing
  contributors to proofread recipes, submit pull requests, and enhance the
content.
- **Image Processing:** The book‚Äôs images will be processed using modern tools
  such as Lightroom and ImageMagick to ensure high-quality results for digital
reproduction.

## Workflow

The project follows an agile, sprint-based development model, with the following stages:

1. **Scan & Image Processing:** High-quality scans of the book pages will be
created.
2. **Text Proofreading & Modernization:** Recipes will be proofread and
updated to meet contemporary Chinese language standards.
3. **Proof of Concept & Testing:** A preliminary version (Version 0.0.1
pre-Alpha) will be released for early feedback.
4. **Full Remake Release:** After further refinement, the project will reach
its first "Alpha" release, with fully proofed and modernized content.
